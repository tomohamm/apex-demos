# NYC High Schools Demo (OCI Generative AI)

From precisely summarizing intricate data to crafting context-aware responses, Generative AI stands at the forefront of a technological shift, promising to redefine how we navigate and leverage knowledge in our day-to-day interactions. With the introduction of the native Generative AI Service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), enabling your applications with generative AI capabilities has never been easier.

This application demonstrates how you can bring generative AI capabilities based on large language models (LLMs) to your applications built using Oracle APEX, your favourite low-code Platform. The Generative AI can be accessed through REST APIs and by using powerful REST Data Source capabilities of APEX, you can effortlessly incorporate this advanced technology into your applications with a low-code approach.

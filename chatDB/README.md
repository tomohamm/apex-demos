# Chat DB Demo App

Select AI, a new feature of Autonomous Database, enables users to perform queries on their data using natural language processing. This feature harnesses the power of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate user input text into Oracle SQL queries. By integrating advanced language processing capabilities, users can interact with the database in a more intuitive and user-friendly manner.

Select AI acts as the conduit through which the AI services provided by OpenAI, Cohere or Azure OpenAI are integrated, leveraging the capabilities offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) available in the market today.
